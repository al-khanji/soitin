About Soitin
============

Soitin is a light-weight media player aimed at mobile devices (the Nokia N810
especially), and maybe KDE4 desktops, as Amarok is not yet available. It does
not have many features, which counts as a feature. It can play plain music as
well as files with video. Trivia: Soitin means Player in the Finnish language.

Compiling
=========

Assuming you have Qt >= 4.4 it should be as easy as saying 'qmake', followed
by 'make'. You should now have a new and shiny 'soitin' binary. You can say
'make install' if you want to install it into the system. A .desktop file is
provided. /usr is the default prefix, if you want to install to somewhere else
edit soitin.pro.

Bugs, Patches, and Contact Info
===============================

Soitin is developed by Louai Al-Khanji. Good bug reports are welcome. Patches
are even more welcome. Bear in mind that I might reject your patches if I do
not like them. This means that you should probably discuss the feature first;
Soitin is above all meant to be small, fast and slick.

My current e-mail address is louai.khanji@gmail.com. I also hang out on IRC,
mostly IRCNet and Freenode, where I go by the nick slougi.

License
=======

Soitin is licensed under the zlib license. This means you can do pretty much
whatever you want with it. See the file LICENSING for details.
